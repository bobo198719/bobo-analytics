<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
We may collect personal information such as your name, email address,
company name, and contact details when you submit forms, request a demo,

device type, browser information, IP address, and interaction behavior
may be automatically collected to improve performance and security.
</p>

<p>
This information helps us understand user needs, optimize our services,

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to
protect user data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
These measures include secure hosting environments, encrypted
